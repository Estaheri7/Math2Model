# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for supervised machine learning tasks. KNN is a simple, yet powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression problems.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. It works by finding the `k` closest data points (neighbors) to a given query point and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors.

### Steps of the KNN Algorithm:
1. **Choose the number of neighbors (k)**: This is a hyperparameter that needs to be set before running the algorithm.
2. **Calculate the distance**: Compute the distance between the query point and all the points in the training data. Common distance metrics include Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances.
3. **Find the nearest neighbors**: Identify the `k` data points in the training set that are closest to the query point.
4. **Make a prediction**:
    - For classification: Assign the class that is most common among the `k` nearest neighbors.
    - For regression: Compute the average of the values of the `k` nearest neighbors.

## Conclusion
The KNN algorithm is a versatile and easy-to-understand method for both classification and regression tasks. This repository provides a practical example of how to implement KNN using Python and Scikit-learn.
