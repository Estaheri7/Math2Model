# Clustering with K-Means

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python. The K-Means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning method used for clustering data into distinct groups.

## Algorithm Explanation

K-Means clustering aims to partition `n` observations into `k` clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Randomly select `k` initial centroids from the data points.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming `k` clusters.
3. **Update**: Calculate the new centroids as the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids do not change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Files

- `clustering.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the K-Means algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and the algorithm.

## Example

The notebook includes an example of clustering synthetic data generated using `make_blobs` from the `sklearn.datasets` module. The example demonstrates how to fit the K-Means model to the data and predict the cluster labels.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and clear implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, which can be used as a foundation for understanding and applying clustering techniques in various machine learning tasks.
