    "# Clustering with K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python. The K-Means algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning method used for clustering data into distinct groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition Behind K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Minimize the within-cluster variance (distance between data points and their cluster centroid).\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Each data point is assigned to one of `k` clusters based on proximity to centroids.\n",
    "- **Iterative**: The algorithm iterates between two main steps: **assigning** data points to the nearest cluster and **updating** centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow of K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$, where each $x_i$ is a data point in the feature space:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize centroids**:  \n",
    "   Randomly select `k` data points from X as the initial centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate until convergence**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Assign** each data point to the nearest centroid:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     C(x_i) = \\arg \\min_{c_j} \\| x_i - \\mu_j \\|\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where $C(x_i)$ is the cluster assignment for point $x_i$, and $\\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Update** the centroids based on the mean of all points assigned to each cluster:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} x_i\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where $C_j$ is the set of points assigned to cluster $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat** the above steps until the centroids do not change (i.e., convergence).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Result**: The dataset is partitioned into `k` clusters, each with a centroid representing the mean of the points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_clusters`: The number of clusters to form.\n",
    "- `centroids`: The centroids of the clusters.\n",
    "- `labels`: The cluster assignments for each data point.\n",
    "- `np.linalg.norm`: Computes the Euclidean distance between points and centroids.\n",
    "- `np.argmin`: Assigns each data point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient**: K-Means is computationally efficient with a time complexity of $O(nk)$ per iteration.\n",
    "- **Simple to understand**: The algorithm has a clear and easy-to-implement structure.\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Works well with large datasets when the number of clusters $k$ is relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choosing \\( k \\)**: The number of clusters needs to be predefined, which can be difficult to determine.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to initialization**: The final clusters can depend on the initial centroids, leading to different results in different runs.\n",
    "- **Assumes spherical clusters**: K-means works well for spherical-shaped clusters, but may struggle with more complex shapes.\n",
    "- **Sensitive to outliers**: Outliers can skew the centroid calculation and lead to inaccurate clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** random centroids.\n",
    "2. **Assign** each point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "3. **Update** centroids based on the assigned points.\n",
    "4. **Repeat** until centroids stop changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is a fast and effective clustering algorithm for partitioning a dataset into a specified number of clusters. However, it is sensitive to initialization and may not perform well with non-spherical clusters or datasets with outliers.\n"
