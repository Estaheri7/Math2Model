    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\beta}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "which is:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{w}}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{X}^T(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y}) = 0$$\n",

    "$$ \\boxed{\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, normal equation can find the optimal weights for the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Using the Normal Equation for Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Complexity (O(d³))**:\n",
    "   - The normal equation requires computing $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$  and then inverting the resulting matrix, which has a computational cost of $O(d^3)$, where `d` is the number of features (dimensionality of the feature vector).\n",
    "   - This becomes inefficient for **high-dimensional** datasets, as the matrix inversion grows computationally expensive. For very large `d`, this may become impractical or very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Singular Matrix Issue**:\n",
    "   - If $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ is **singular** or **non-invertible** (i.e., its determinant is zero), the normal equation cannot be solved. This typically happens when:\n",
    "     - **Multicollinearity** exists in the dataset (i.e., some features are linearly dependent or highly correlated).\n",
    "     - **Insufficient data** relative to the number of features.\n",
    "   - In these cases, regularization techniques or dimensionality reduction methods are needed to ensure invertibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Usage**:\n",
    "   - For very large datasets with many features `d`, storing and manipulating the matrices $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ can require substantial memory, which may not be feasible in low-memory environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Doesn't Scale Well with Large Datasets**:\n",
    "   - For large datasets with a large number of training examples `N`, the **gradient descent** method might be more efficient because it updates weights iteratively, rather than requiring the entire matrix to be inverted. This makes **gradient descent** better suited for big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Flexibility for Regularization**:\n",
    "   - The normal equation by itself doesn't incorporate **regularization** (e.g., L2 or L1 regularization), which is often necessary to prevent overfitting in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, gradient descent can be easily modified to include regularization terms like Ridge regression or Lasso regression."

    "- The gradient is computed using the entire dataset, and the weights are updated after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**\n",

    "# Linear Regression with Regularizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the goal is to fit a model that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. However, in many real-world problems, this approach can lead to **overfitting**, where the model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of the actual underlying patterns. This typically happens when we have a large number of features or when the model is too complex for the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when the model is too \"flexible\" and captures not just the true relationships but also the noise in the data. This can result in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen (test) data, as it has essentially \"memorized\" the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the model from fitting the noise by shrinking the magnitude of the coefficients. In this way, the model is forced to find a balance between fitting the training data and keeping the model as simple as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing a regularization term, we add a cost to the model’s complexity, typically by penalizing large weights. This helps in reducing the model's variance and improving its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily two types of regularization techniques used in linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression adds a penalty proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients. The loss function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\| X\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y} \\|^2 + \\lambda \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength (also called the Ridge parameter).\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This penalty shrinks the coefficients by forcing them to be small, but it does not set them exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression adds a penalty proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. The loss function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\| X\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y} \\|^2 + \\lambda \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength (also called the Lasso parameter).\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso has the added benefit of performing **feature selection**, as it can drive some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Elastic Net Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 penalties. The loss function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\| X\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{y} \\|^2 + \\lambda \\left( \\alpha \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|_1 + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2} \\| \\mathbf{w} \\|_2^2 \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the regularization strength.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ controls the mix between Lasso $(\\alpha = 1)$ and Ridge $(\\alpha = 0)$ regularization.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net is useful when there are many correlated features, as it tends to select one feature from a group of correlated features, unlike Lasso.\n"
