# Regression Algorithms in Machine Learning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various regression algorithms used in supervised machine learning. Regression algorithms are used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.

## Algorithms Covered

**Linear Regression**
    - A simple algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
