This repository is a comprehensive collection of notebooks that walk through the theory and implementation of core **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms, with a strong emphasis on **Computer Vision**.

Some models are built purely from scratch using **NumPy**, while others leverage **PyTorch** for more advanced implementations. Each notebook aims to explain the **mathematical foundations**, **algorithmic intuition**, and **hands-on coding practices** used in real-world vision systems.
