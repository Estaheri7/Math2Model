# Simple CNN for Computer Vision

This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for computer vision tasks. The notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model using a popular deep learning framework.

## Algorithm Explanation

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. The key components of a CNN include:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolution operations to the input data, using filters to detect various features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
2. **Pooling Layers**: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, helping to decrease the computational load and control overfitting.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers are used at the end of the network to perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers.

The CNN model in this notebook is trained on a dataset of images to classify them into different categories. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual labels.
